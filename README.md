Pacioli
=======
Pacioli is an accounting and project management system.

This has two database engines.  The Sqlite version depends on sqlite4java, available at https://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/.  Use pacioli.ui.Pacioli to run.

The H2 version depends on h2-1.4.177.jar available at http://www.h2database.com/.  Use pacioli.ui.PacioliH2 to run.  H2 is very fast and is in all Java, but it capitalizes the tablenames and column names.
