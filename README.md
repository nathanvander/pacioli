Pacioli
=======
Pacioli is an accounting and project management system.

This has two database engines.  The Sqlite version depends on sqlite4java, available at https://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/.  Use pacioli.ui.Pacioli to run.

The H2 version depends on h2-1.4.177.jar available at http://www.h2database.com/.  Use pacioli.ui.PacioliH2 to run.  H2 is very fast and is in all Java, but it capitalizes the tablenames and column names.

Update 1/23/2017: I am on version 3 of this.  The first was never finished.  The second is in directory pacioli2 and is also not finished.
The third is in nathanvander.pacioli and it depends on my apollo code.  This will have a number of interfaces in nathanvander.pacioli.iface.  The first one is Security.
